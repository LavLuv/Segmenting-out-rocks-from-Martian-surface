# Segmenting out rocks from Martian surface

Using a dataset of images of the Martian surface, segmenting out rocks from those surface images to further better utilize them for analysis of mineral composition on the Martian surface  

This has numerous practical applications like: the determination and study of various mineral resources present on the Martian surface/in the soil, the determination of the proportion of those minerals, determining or predicting other such geological features. These become more crucial knowing that Mars is the closest planet in our Solar System with hospitable living conditions
